# Spappz's VTT Tooler Suite

Here lies a collection of [PowerShell](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) scripts designed to automate conversion of homebrew to the [5etools' homebrew](https://github.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew) schema from various virtual tabletops (VTTs). For more information, check the `README.md` in each folder.

~~This collection will slowly grow.~~

All scripts are functional for Powershell versions 5.1 (default version installed on Windows 10) and higher. Yeah, the code's pretty ugly, but it works on my machine. üòéüëç

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Maintenance mode

I no longer have interest in developing this project. I'll endeavour to fix small bugs in the existing converters as Foundry changes and (most importantly!) [issues are raised](https://github.com/Spappz/VTT-Tooler-Suite/issues/new), but, besides outside contribution (pull requests welcome), I won't be fiddling with this any more.
