# Spappz's VTT Tooler Suite

Here lies a collection of [PowerShell](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) scripts designed to automate conversion of homebrew to the [5etools' homebrew](https://github.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew) schema from various virtual tabletops (VTTs). For more information, check the `README.md` in each folder.

This collection will slowly grow.

All scripts are functional for Powershell versions 5.1 (default version installed on Windows 10) and higher. Yeah, the code's pretty ugly, but it works on my machine. 😎👍
